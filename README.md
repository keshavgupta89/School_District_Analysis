# School District Analysis (Using Panda)

## Overview of Project

We have been provided raw data for 15 schools in a district so that we can analyse it and check their performances.


### Purpose

The project requires us to clean, format and analyse the data of a School in a district for grade 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th, for reading and math subject.


## Analytical Results
After analysising the data
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was
 affected by the changes in the data 	
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

### *How is the district summary affected?
After merging the school data with student data, we were able to see that 15 schools in a district having a total student strength as 39,170 had a total budget of $24.65 million. The average math and reading score are 78.9% and 81.9% respectively. We are also able to analyse the percent of student passing in math, reading, both are 74.8%, 85.7% and 64.9% respectively.

### *How is the school summary affected?
After analysing the school data, we have received the school summary in a tabular form. The table includes Name of the School, School type, Total students in each school, Budget of each school, budget per student, Average math and reading scores, Percent of students passing math, reading and both. 

### *How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
On replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores, we can see the performance of Thomas High School’s increased quite a bit, relative to the other schools. The percent of students passing increased and the rank of the school increased from 8th to 2nd performance wise.

### *How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

-Math and reading scores by grade
After replacing the ninth grade score for Thomas High School with Nan(Null). The difference between the result in the two analysis is for Thomas High School which is very neglible on a big data set.


-Scores by school spending
After replacing the ninth grade score for Thomas High School with Nan(Null). The difference between the result in the two analysis is for Thomas High School which is very neglible on a big data set.

-Scores by school size
After replacing the ninth grade score for Thomas High School with Nan(Null). The difference between the result in the two analysis is for Thomas High School which is very neglible on a big data set.

-Scores by school type
After replacing the ninth grade score for Thomas High School with Nan(Null). The difference between the result in the two analysis is for Thomas High School which is very neglible on a big data set.


## Summary:
After analysising the two dataset I have an observation that the data was either spread on the extreme of high i.e. the score for grade 9 for Thomas High School is very high or they were below 70 that is why the passing percent is increased considerably after the deletion on that data.
